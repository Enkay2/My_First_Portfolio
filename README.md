This repository contains a series of basic HTML web pages I created as part of my learning journey into web development. The goal was to understand how to build structured, semantic, and interactive web pages using only HTML



It includes several tasks that cover:

\- Writing valid HTML

\- Creating multi-page websites

\- Embedding content (like tweets and images)

\- Using semantic tags

\- Designing a personal portfolio page
